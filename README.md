# ChurnPrediction
At Sunbase, we prioritize understanding our customers and ensuring their satisfaction. To achieve this, 
we want to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn. Your task as a Machine 
Learning Intern is to work on this project, following the guidelines and responsibilities outlined in the job 
description.
:
 Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or 
neural networks).
 Train and validate the selected model on the training dataset.
 Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, 
F1-score).
4. Model Optimization:
 Fine-tune the model parameters to improve its predictive performance.
 Explore techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
5. Model Deployment:
 Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it into a production-like 
environment (you can simulate this in a development environment).
 Ensure the model can take new customer data as input and provide churn predictions.
Deliverables:
1. Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing your code.
2. A brief report summarizing your approach, including any data preprocessing, feature 
engineering, and model selection decisions.
3. Model performance metrics and visualizations.
